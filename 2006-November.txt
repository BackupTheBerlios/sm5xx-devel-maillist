Subject: sm5xx sucessfully running on pxa255, kernel 2.6.19-rc4
Message-ID: <1163160122.6318.18.camel@platon>

Hi all,

at least I made the driver successfully running on my pxa255 based
device! There are still some open issues like suspend / resume.

As a base I took revision 8 from the berlios svn. I added a plattform
device driver and made some minor enhancements in the code and made
changes to the KConfig / Makefile to include the driver in the linux
source tree.

I would like to contribute my work back into you sourcetree. Do you have
any preferences how to generate a patch? From the svn tree or from the
linux source tree?

Btw: Has anybody just used the internal sm5xx USB Host controller?


Thanks for your support and the great code!

Best regards,

Ole Reinhardt

I think that all files, which depend on sm5xx should be sent to svn,
later they may be simply resynched with kernel.

Preferably in kernel style (don't forget Signed-off-by).
Firstly send patch here (in maillist), if nobody haven't objections,
then _after acknowledge_ checked-in it to a svn.

(Certainly, you are needed in write access to a svn, register at
berlios and tell me your account).

P.S. In this month I'm very busy, so I'm sorry for a long delay.

Subject: ohci driver
Message-ID: <1163772789.6207.24.camel@platon>

Hi all,

I queded my patch a little and first would like to finish my sm5xx ohci
driver. 

My ohci driver just works a little bit, but still seems to have some
problems I don't yet see. 

Has anybody managed to write an sm501 ohci driver that is not designed
for sh linux? I took the voyager-gx sh linux ohci driver and modified it
to work on my pxa255 based machine with arm-linux 2.6.19-rc5

My problems:

- I can't use the sm501 irq demux framework for the ohci, as the hdc
driver want to register it's interrups by itself. So i register the
sm501 irq as edge triggered share irq in sm5xx_bus.c and modified the
demux routine to give back the irq (IRQ_NONE) if it's an IRQ from the
OHCI part of the sm501 device.

Could this introduce any missbehaviour? Framebuffer ist still working
well, So I don't suppose to have a problem here.

- When I start up the ohci driver, the sm501 ohci is correctly
recognised. And seems to get started up too. Some ohci interrups occur.
When there is a usb device connected at startup, it is recognized
correctly as well. But then the driver hangs when getting the first
OHCI_INTR_SF. This interrupt is never cleared and so it is called again
and again all over the time. As a result the kernel hangs. It seems that
the ohci did not start up realy or is loosing some information anywhere.
I don't know what's going wrong.

If I insert an usb device later on it is not recognised at all.

I would be glad about any hints!

Best regards,

Ole Reinhardt

sm5xx_fb_default_var, module_param(active_plane, int, ....) (at the
bottom of sm5xx_fb.c) must be correct too.

Default/active plane(s) must be, certainly, selected by driver
parameter, but...

Properly speaking, we are use SM5xx on our MPC5200 based board.
So this driver, by definition, working on PPC ;).
AFAIK, only one problem exist in kernel FB: it is 16bpp (AKA RGB565).
(in DirectFB and in X such problem worked around)

P.S. Stephen, as I pointed in my mail, which you are quote,
sm5xx-devel at lists.berlios.de is working, so, please, CC such mails
in this list too.

I added the options as the following to use your drivers, but, I can't 
get anything from the CRT monitor,    
     <*> Multifuncation miscellaneous 
devices                                    
        <*>   Silicon Motion SM5XX companion chips 
support                            
              SM5xx family member (Silicon Motion SM501 (VoyagerGX) 
support)  --->      
              Main system connection type (Connected through PCI (pin to 
pin or plugged i
          [*] Bus master support 
     
    <*>   Silicon Motion SM501 (VoyagerGX)/SM511 framebuffer support....

I found there isn't code in sm5xx_platform.c, so it should be work with 
the Connected through PCI (pin to pin or plugged in the slot) system 
connetc type,  so, my issue is that I didn't set the 
sm5xx_fb_default_var correctly,isn't it? and I have ported the  
linuxppc_2_4_devel.git code to my system and it could  work  on my PPC 
405ep board to support dual  CRT monitors with 8bpp, and if there is any 
good news, I'll report to the mail-list: 
sm5xx-devel at lists.berlios.de,Thanks.

Is SM5xx on your MPC5200 based board  on PCI bus?
