Subject: SM501 driver pushed upstream!
Message-ID: <45815B3D.7060206@anagramm.de>

Hi There!

I just want to let you know that Ben Dooks is about to pushed
his work of a SM501 mfd driver upstream:
See the thread at:

http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/13/134

Thanks, Ben!
You are welcome to join our group at sm5xx-devel @lists.berlios,de
if you haven't already.
We are working (more or less intensively ;-) on the SM501 driver 
support.

For my part, I wasn't able to participate much due to my project
schedule. However I am willing to test your code ASAP on my embedded
PowerPC.

Best greets,
