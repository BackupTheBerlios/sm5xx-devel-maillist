<PRE>Hi all,

I queded my patch a little and first would like to finish my sm5xx ohci
driver. 

My ohci driver just works a little bit, but still seems to have some
problems I don't yet see. 

Has anybody managed to write an sm501 ohci driver that is not designed
for sh linux? I took the voyager-gx sh linux ohci driver and modified it
to work on my pxa255 based machine with arm-linux 2.6.19-rc5

My problems:

- I can't use the sm501 irq demux framework for the ohci, as the hdc
driver want to register it's interrups by itself. So i register the
sm501 irq as edge triggered share irq in sm5xx_bus.c and modified the
demux routine to give back the irq (IRQ_NONE) if it's an IRQ from the
OHCI part of the sm501 device.

Could this introduce any missbehaviour? Framebuffer ist still working
well, So I don't suppose to have a problem here.

- When I start up the ohci driver, the sm501 ohci is correctly
recognised. And seems to get started up too. Some ohci interrups occur.
When there is a usb device connected at startup, it is recognized
correctly as well. But then the driver hangs when getting the first
OHCI_INTR_SF. This interrupt is never cleared and so it is called again
and again all over the time. As a result the kernel hangs. It seems that
the ohci did not start up realy or is loosing some information anywhere.
I don't know what's going wrong.

If I insert an usb device later on it is not recognised at all.

I would be glad about any hints!

Best regards,

Ole Reinhardt
