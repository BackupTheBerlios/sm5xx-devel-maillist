No, the LF means RoHS (LeadFree). The 08 means 8MBytes VideoRam
The Chip is called SM501GX. I don't know anything about a SM510.
I just remember that they fixed some SM510-&gt;SM501 typo in a manual
according to a ChangeList.
I don't know anything about a planned rev. AC.

The differences of the revisions?
Oh, that's not really easy to tell...
You need to check the Schematics of the Demo board which has some
comments of version changes, then the Manuals and finally, the Errata Sheet.
You get all those from Silicon Motions FTP Server at:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.siliconmotion.com.tw/">ftp://ftp.siliconmotion.com.tw/</A>

I.e. there are some strange things mentioned that the Demo Board with Rev. AA
uses the TESTCLK input instead of the internal PLL.
Some GPIO changed it's bootstrap functionality.. and so on.

I currently have serious hw problems with my rev. AB chip. My Framebuffer
driver starts's working and an image I write to /dev/fb0 get clocked out to the
Flat Panel as usual. But once I start X or once I write more data to /dev/fb0,
the SM501 crashes badly, so that the pixelclock just stops (which gives
a colorful image fading out on the display) And I have to power down the whole
think until I can retry.
I checked the voltages and clocks really carefully, but I wasn't able to track down
that problem. Are there some HW designers who had similar problems?

Best greets,

Clemens Koller
