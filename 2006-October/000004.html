Heh, you need to talk to the guy at the door.  He'll let anyone in, I'm 
proof!  :)

I totally agree on all points.  But I hate blobs.  If the source code is 
around, I'd love to have it recorded somewhere even though we all know 
that Kbuild and most users won't know what to do with it.  Just In Case.

Do we even know where this blob came from originally?

&gt;<i>On that note, do you have a pointer to some of the various ALSA
</I>&gt;<i>implementations that are floating around? I've only seen the OSS driver
</I>&gt;<i>we had in CVS, and that provides a rather dysmal starting point..

Whaley sent me one just last week (hi Robert!).  Given that, I don't 
suppose he'd mind my forwarding the patch on.  What makes it tricky to 
do so is that the patch is against his highly-evolved sm501 driver 
stack, so there will be some mending required.

Yet another reason why we've all got to get all this stuff together.  
The SM501 is a decent chip, and there's too few of us to go around 
re-inventing the wheel.
