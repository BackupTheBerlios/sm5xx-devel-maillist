Subject: sm501 on pxa255 with the kernel 2.6.20
Message-ID: <000001c76107$72a882e0$0c00a8c0@Papacp>

Hi 

 

I currently work on pxa255 base board with a sm501 for graphic, usb host and
serial port. I successful use the frame buffer, but I have a probleme with
USB Host. 

 

I just want to know if someone as made his own ohci-usb driver.

 

Best regards

Nice, that this list isn't completely down... however somehow redundant now.

I am using the SM501 on PCI on an MPC8540 PowerPC using one of the
latest 2.6.21-rc1 Kernels.
However, I didn't check out the USB part in detail.
lspci shows me the SM501 (and the framebuffer driver is working)
but lsusb doesn't show me any OHCI controllers.

You might want to check out the latest git kernel-tree and contact
the two guys who pushed that driver to the kernel (thanks to them!).
They are also subscribed on the linux-fbdev-devel list.

Best greets,

Me too, I'm using this driver on a pxa255 based machine with good
success concerning the video driver part, but with no success with my
own ohci driver.

AFAIK there are two known issues with the OHCI in the SM501

1.) The ohci dma is broken and you can only access internal RAM ==> You
have to write a special dma allocator to access the internal sm501
memory as dma.

2.) The sm501 has a bug with the internal memory cache. You need to read
every ms from a spare address in the internal memory range to flush the
sm501 internal cache.

I tried to implement a workaround for both of these problems. It seems
that the DMA works at least a little bit, but I can not succeed at least
a single usb transfer. 

- OHCI gets initialized
- USB devices are recognised
- connect / disconnect seems to work
- address asignement fails

If you like I'll send you my code, with is based on a 2.6.20 kernel.
Drop me a line if you'r interested.

Please read the sm501 errata documents and usb host implementation
instructions. They are only for the windows counterpart, but this
documents give you a hint what to do.

chapter aa-10:

If anyone hast better news or any further ideas how to solve this
problem, please let me know.

This is great news! Is this driver usable for pci only and/or is it
platform independant? Is it just included in 2.6.20? I have not found
any up to now...

Can the internal 8051 help you solving that job? I've heard that
for the AC97 audio there should be also DMA issues. And there
might be a work around in that area by letting the 8051 so some
dirty stuff.
(Don't ask me details... That's all I know about that topic.)

Another story:
There was an article in the CIE (Components in Electronics)
in January 2007 which said:

-----8<-----
Article 	January 2007   	
Ultra low power graphics and co-processor

Silicon Motion is continuing to expand its mobile graphics product line 
with the introduction of the SM502, available in the UK from Sabre 
Advanced Microelectronics.

The SM502 is an enhanced version of the SM501, with increased 2D and 
video acceleration performance and ultra low power consumption for 
resolutions up to 1280 x1024. It has a flexible bus interface supporting 
a direct connection to 32-bit embedded CPUs or PCI 33/66, and dual ZV 
port with ITU656 support for multiple data stream capture and real-time 
display and colour space conversion capability.

Other key features include a programmable panel clock (PCLK) for 
frequency customisation to support standard and non-standard panel 
timings; integrated I/O; 0 or 8MB integrated memory; and LCD, CRT or TV 
support with flexible display configurations.

The SM502 is pin-to-pin and software backwards compatible with the SM501.

The article seems not being online at CIE anymore, I extracted the
above information from Google Cache.

It (2.6.21-rc1) works on PCI on my PowerPC mpc8540ads compatible
platform.

However, according to the description of the kernel option it should
be "versatile". And I know several setups with the SM501 on the
local bus of some PowerPC working fine.

Sorry, the platform we are working with is not our own, so I don't see
much of a chance to get newer hardware :-(

Bye,

Well... I didn't tell you that you have to change your chip.
I changed some SM501 on my hardware by hand, so I would do it
again instead of fixing stupid things in software. :-)

I will ask our distributor about the status of the SM502.
I don't think it's available yet (or at all).
